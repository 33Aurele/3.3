    This isn't very useful because Shun Goku Satsu only has 2 recovery frames so it's very hard to punish that way.
    Don't let go of the charge during the super. 
    If the Hayate is fully charged and comes out, you will get grabbed.

    Depending on where the first hit hits you, Hugo can be close or far.
    If he's very far, don't use HP and go directly for Hayate.
    If he's very close, you can use EX Fukiage to punish (even reversal MP Fukiage in the corner).
